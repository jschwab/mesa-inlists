* mesa-superchandra-r6596
This is the inlists and machinery used for the calculations of models
M15 and M16 shown throughout the paper. (It's basically my MESA work
directory, but without the boilerplate files.)

The script ~run_model.sh~ will run all 4 phases of model M15 (cflame,
kh, neflame, khNe).  Be warned, it'll take a few months (all spent in
neflame).  The ~models~ directory has the starting models and some of
the intermediate results.

* find-critical-mass
This is the inlists and machinery used to find the critical ignition
mass as discussed in Appendix C.  (It's basically my MESA work
directory, but without the boilerplate files.)

Run ~make_inlists.rb~, which generates the inlists using Bill Wolf's
[[https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript][MesaScript]].  Then ~make_models.sh~ generates initial models of varying
masses and ~evolve_models.sh~ evolves them to ignition (or
non-ignition).  There is some logic to determine what happens in
~src/run_star_extras.f~.
