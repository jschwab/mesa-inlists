* make-HeCO-models
This directory produces the schematic merger models. It was run with
MESA r11701.

The script =basic_heco.rb= generates the inlists.  This makes use of
Bill Wolf's [[https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript][MesaScript]].

The PBS batch script =make_models.sh= runs these inlists.  For
convenience, this the generated models are included in the folder
final_models.
