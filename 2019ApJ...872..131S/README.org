* Section 4
These are the inlists and machinery used for the calculations of the
ONe WD models with carbon shown in Section 4 of this paper.  They used
MESA version r10398.

The script =make_models.sh= generates the initial models (using MESA
r10000).  For study of the carbon fraction there is a [[https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript][MesaScript]] file
(e.g. =composition.rb=) that generates the inlists and then a bash
job script (e.g. =composition.sh=) that runs them all.
